# Projects Portfolio - Mechanical Engineering and Data Science

Welcome to my projects portfolio! I am a highly motivated individual with a strong background in Mechanical Engineering and a passion for Data Science and Advanced Analytics. Throughout my academic journey, I have acquired diverse skills that bridge the gap between engineering principles and cutting-edge data-driven technologies.

## Mechanical Engineering Projects:

In my Bachelor's program in Mechanical Engineering, I tackled various projects that honed my problem-solving abilities and analytical mindset. I delved into areas such as finite element analysis, thermodynamics, fluid mechanics, and design optimization. These projects not only challenged me to develop innovative solutions but also taught me how to work collaboratively in a team.

## Data Science and Advanced Analytics:

Currently pursuing a Master's in Data Science and Advanced Analytics, I am immersing myself in the world of data. I have gained expertise in machine learning, statistical analysis, data visualization, and big data processing. Leveraging Python, R, and other tools, I am exploring the realm of predictive modeling, natural language processing, and more.

## Portfolio Highlights:

1. Heart Disease Classifier using Logistic Regression: Implemented a machine learning model to predict the presence or absence of heart disease in a given sample

As I continue my journey into the world of data science, I am excited to take on new challenges and apply my engineering expertise to solve real-world problems using data-driven approaches. Feel free to explore my projects to gain insights into my skills and achievements. I am always open to collaborating on new and exciting data science ventures.

# [Project 1: Heart Disease Classifier using Logistic Regression](https://github.com/andre10112001/Project-1---Heart-Failure-Predict/tree/main)

This project implements a Logistic Regression model in Jupyter Notebook to predict the presence or absence of heart disease in a given sample. The model is trained using a dataset sourced from Kaggle, which contains various medical attributes for each sample, along with a binary target variable indicating the presence (1) or absence (0) of heart disease.

The Logistic Regression algorithm is a powerful tool for binary classification tasks like this one. By training the model on the provided dataset, we aim to create an accurate classifier capable of early detection and diagnosis of heart disease, contributing to better patient outcomes.

Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I look forward to connecting with you!
