# [Project 1: Heart Disease Classifier using Logistic Regression](https://github.com/andre10112001/Project-1---Heart-Failure-Predict/tree/main)

This project implements a Logistic Regression model in Jupyter Notebook to predict the presence or absence of heart disease in a given sample. The model is trained using a dataset sourced from Kaggle, which contains various medical attributes for each sample, along with a binary target variable indicating the presence (1) or absence (0) of heart disease.

The Logistic Regression algorithm is a powerful tool for binary classification tasks like this one. By training the model on the provided dataset, we aim to create an accurate classifier capable of early detection and diagnosis of heart disease, contributing to better patient outcomes.
